Vertigo Javascript API
======================

Vertigo is a fast, reliable, fault-tolerant event processing framework built on
the [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) application platform. Combining concepts of
cutting-edge [real-time systems](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/) and
[flow-based programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming),
Vertigo allows real-time problems to be broken down into smaller tasks (as
Vert.x verticles) and distributed across a Vert.x cluster. Vertigo provides
fault-tolerance for data streams and components, allowing developers to spend more
time focusing on application code.
